This package is part of a [refactoring of PySAL](https://github.com/pysal/pysal/wiki/PEP-13:-Refactor-PySAL-Using-Submodules).

--------------------------------------

Spaghetti is an open-source python library for the analysis of network-based spatial data. Originating from the `network` module in [PySAL (Python Spatial Analysis Library)](http://pysal.org), it is under active development for the inclusion of newly proposed methods for building graph-theoretic networks and the analysis of network events.
